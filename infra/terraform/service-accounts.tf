# in-place update to frontend/backend/order-worker fails with a 403 without it.

# *mint a token as* this caller (serviceAccountTokenCreator), never granted
# run.invoker themselves. A single identity is sufficient here because both
# grants would be identical (run.invoker on order-worker only) and the two
# trigger sources are already distinguishable by the endpoint each calls
# (/internal/sync-order vs /internal/scheduled-order-discovery).
